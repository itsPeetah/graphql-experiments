# graphql-first-steps
Just trying to learn some graphql

## What's in here
- Simple in-memory database with artists and songs.
- GraphQL schema with root query and mutation
- Some CRUD operations

## What I still want to implement
- Error handling inside of the resolvers
- Perhaps define the schema in **.gql** files?
- Integrate TypeScript
- Client/Server configuration
